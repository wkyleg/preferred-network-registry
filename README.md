Smart contract for users to proclaimed their preferred networks

Users can their prefered networks corresponding to [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org) and expect to receive payments on that network.

This is intented to be a light wrapper for Viem like resolving ENS names.

This is a very early proof of concept but I'll be adding unit tests, more linting, better use of Viem typing, some auditing of the contract in the intrests of getting this deployed. Also a static GUI site where users can change their preference in network.
